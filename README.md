<h1>AutoHotkey Profiles</h1>
<p>Profiles that remap keys for the <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotkey</a> application</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Each profile is represented by corresponding AHK, and EXE files.</p>
<p>To use any profile, simply run its executable.</p>
<p>To modify any profile, go to <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotkey.com</a> for installation and documentation</p>
<h2>Profiles</h2>
<h3>profile</h3>
<p>The following are the profile's defined hotkeys</p>
<h4>CapsLock</h4>
<p>`CapsLock` rebound to `LCtrl`, and if `CapsLock` is then released without pressing any other key, the script sends an `Escape` press.</p>
<h4>Left Ctrl</h4>
<p>`LCtrl` rebound to `CapsLock`.</p>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3>Profile Running but not Working</h3>
<p>If the window currently in focus is running with admin privileges, remember to run the profile's executable with admin privileges aswell.</p>
